This is an [Awesome List](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md) of games you can play in [the R language](https://www.r-project.org/), which is (supposed to be) a 'free software environment for statistical computing and graphics'.

Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/matt-dray/awesome-r-games/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/matt-dray/awesome-r-games/pulls) to add games to this list, or if you're a creator and you want some details changed.

Games provided in self-contained R packages are indicated by their names being wrapped in curly braces, i.e. '{example}'.
