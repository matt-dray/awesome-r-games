This is an [Awesome List](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md) of games you can play in [the R language](https://www.r-project.org/), which is (supposed to be) a 'free software environment for statistical computing and graphics'.

Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/matt-dray/awesome-r-games/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/matt-dray/awesome-r-games/pulls) to adjust the list. Add the game alphabetically to the relevant section like `* Game ([source](<link>)) by [Name](<link>)`. Add other links if relevant, like a blog post or live app, and put the game name in {curly braces} (`{}`) if it's an R package.
